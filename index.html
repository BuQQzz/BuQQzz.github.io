    <h1>Origins of AI</h1>
    <h2>Early Concepts</h2>
    <p>The idea of intelligent machines has been around for centuries. But only in the mid-20th century did computer scientists begin seriously tackling artificial intelligence, founded on the assumption that human intelligence could be replicated.</p>
    <h2>Founding Fathers</h2>
    <p>Alan Turing's 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" posed the question "Can machines think?" John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955 and organized the pioneering Dartmouth Conference.</p>
    <h2>Early Milestones</h2>
    <p>Some early AI milestones include the Logic Theorist in 1956, the General Problem Solver in 1957, SHRDLU in 1968 for natural language processing, and expert systems like Dendral.</p>
