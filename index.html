<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Origins of AI</h1>

<h2>Early Concepts</h2>

<p style="padding: 20px;">The idea of intelligent machines has been around for centuries. But only in the mid-20th century did computer scientists begin seriously tackling artificial intelligence, founded on the assumption that human intelligence could be replicated.</p>

<h2>Founding Fathers</h2>

<p style="padding: 20px;">Alan Turing's 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" posed the question "Can machines think?" John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955 and organized the pioneering Dartmouth Conference.</p>

<h2>Early Milestones</h2>

<p style="padding: 20px;">Some early AI milestones include the Logic Theorist in 1956, the General Problem Solver in 1957, SHRDLU in 1968 for natural language processing, and expert systems like Dendral.</p>
