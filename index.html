  <h1>The Origins of AI</h1>

  <h2>Early Concepts</h2>

  <p>The idea of intelligent machines has been around for centuries...</p>

  <p>But only in the mid-20th century did computer scientists begin seriously tackling the problem of artificial intelligence. The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence could be defined and replicated.</p>

  <h2>Founding Fathers</h2>

  <p>Alan Turing, a British mathematician, wrote a seminal paper in 1950 called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." It posed the question "Can machines think?"</p>
  
  <p>John McCarthy, an American computer scientist, coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955. He organized the Dartmouth Conference that year, which is considered the founding event of AI research.</p>
